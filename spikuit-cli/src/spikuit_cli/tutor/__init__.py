"""Tutor — scaffolded review sessions driven by ExamPlan.

Declarative session abstraction: an ExamPlan describes the sequence of
quizzes + transition rules + pedagogical policy. TutorSession is a pure
interpreter that walks the plan.

LLM-dependent quiz grading is handled through the injectable
``LLMGrader`` Protocol (see ``spikuit_cli.quiz.grader``). The cli package
is self-sufficient: Flashcards work without any grader, FreeResponseQuiz
falls back to self-grade or can use any LLMGrader implementation.
