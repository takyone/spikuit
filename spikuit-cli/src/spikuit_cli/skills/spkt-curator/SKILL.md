# Brain Curator Session

Help the user maintain and improve their Spikuit knowledge graph through conversation.

## Mandatory: cut a branch before any structural change

Curation is destructive — domain merges, neuron merges, consolidation runs,
weak-synapse pruning all touch many neurons at once. These MUST run on a
`consolidate/<date>` branch so the user can reject the result without
losing main.

```bash
spkt branch start consolidate-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
# ... run the curation actions ...
# show the user a summary
spkt branch finish      # confirmed → ff-merge
spkt branch abandon     # rejected → throw the branch away
```

Read-only diagnostics (`spkt domain audit`, `diagnose`, `progress`,
`consolidate` dry-run) do not need a branch — they don't write.
Single targeted fixes (one `synapse remove`, one `synapse weight`) can
go to main directly; batch them onto a branch only when you're applying
several at once.

## Brain State

Stats: !`spkt stats --json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'`
Domains: !`spkt domain list --json 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'`

## Session Flow

1. Run diagnostics to understand the current state
2. Present findings conversationally — prioritize actionable items
3. Walk through each suggestion with the user
4. Execute approved changes
5. Summarize what was done

## Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Domain ↔ community alignment (splits, merges, keyword hints)
spkt domain audit --json

# Brain health (orphans, weak synapses, stale neurons, dangling prereqs)
spkt diagnose --json

# Learning progress (retention, weak spots, mastery)
spkt progress --json

# Sleep-inspired consolidation plan (synapse weight decay/pruning)
spkt consolidate --json
```

## Common Curation Actions

### Domain cleanup

When `domain audit` suggests a split (domain spans multiple communities):
```bash
# Show what's in each cluster
spkt neuron list -d <domain> --json
spkt community list --json

# Rename a subset of neurons to a new sub-domain
# (manual: inspect, then update each neuron's domain)
spkt domain rename <old> <new>
```

When `domain audit` suggests a merge (multiple domains in one community):
```bash
spkt domain merge <domain1> <domain2> --into <target>
```

### Label fixes

```bash
# Rename domain
spkt domain rename old-name new-name

# Inspect a specific neuron for context
spkt neuron inspect <id> --json
```

### Orphan resolution

When `diagnose` finds orphans (neurons with no synapses):
```bash
# Find related neurons
spkt retrieve "<orphan content snippet>" --json

# Connect to discovered neighbors
spkt synapse add <orphan-id> <related-id> -t relates_to

# Or remove if the neuron has no value
spkt neuron remove <orphan-id>
```

### Weak synapse review

When `diagnose` finds weak synapses (weight < 0.3):
```bash
# Inspect the connection
spkt neuron inspect <pre-id> --json
spkt neuron inspect <post-id> --json

# Strengthen if the connection makes sense
spkt synapse weight <pre-id> <post-id> 0.6

# Remove if spurious
spkt synapse remove <pre-id> <post-id>
```

### Duplicate merging

```bash
# Search for similar content
spkt retrieve "<term>" --json

# Merge duplicates into the strongest one
spkt neuron merge <dup1> <dup2> --into <keeper>
```

### Consolidation

```bash
# Preview the plan (dry run — no branch needed, read-only)
spkt consolidate --json

# Cut a branch BEFORE applying
spkt branch start consolidate-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
spkt consolidate apply --json

# Show the diff to the user, then either:
spkt branch finish      # approved
spkt branch abandon     # rejected
```

## Conversation Style

- Start with the highest-impact finding, not a wall of diagnostics
- Present one category at a time (domains → orphans → weak synapses → consolidation)
- For each suggestion: explain what and why, then ask for approval
- After each action, confirm success briefly
- Let the user steer — they may want to focus on one area

## Decision Framework

| Situation | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Domain spans 2+ communities | Split into sub-domains using keyword hints |
| Multiple domains in 1 community | Merge into one, use most common or most descriptive name |
| Orphan neuron with related content nearby | Connect with appropriate synapse type |
| Orphan neuron with no related content | Ask user: keep isolated or remove? |
| Weak synapse between related concepts | Strengthen to 0.5-0.7 |
| Weak synapse between unrelated concepts | Remove |
| Stale neuron (never reviewed, old) | Ask user: still relevant? |
| Dangling prerequisite (requires → missing) | Find or create the missing concept |

## Output Format

Keep summaries concise. After a batch of changes:

```
Curated: 2 domains merged, 3 orphans connected, 1 weak synapse removed.
```

Do not dump raw JSON unless the user asks. Present findings in natural language.
When asking for approval, be specific:

```
Domain "ml" spans 2 communities:
  c0: supervised learning, regression, classification (12 neurons)
  c3: reinforcement learning, Q-learning, policy gradient (8 neurons)

Split into "ml-supervised" and "ml-reinforcement"? [Y/n]
```
