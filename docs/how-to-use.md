# Portable QABot bundle (read-only, with embeddings)
spkt export --format qabot -o qa-bundle.db
```

### Versioning & Undo

`spkt init` creates a git repository inside your brain so every change is
tracked. Agents are expected to cut a short-lived branch before any batch
work, then fast-forward into `main` once you've reviewed the result.

```bash
# Cut a branch before batch ingestion or curation
spkt branch start papers-2026-04        # → ingest/papers-2026-04
spkt source ingest ./papers/ -d math
# ...review the diff...
spkt branch finish                      # ff-merge into main
spkt branch abandon                     # or throw the branch away
```

Branch prefixes by intent:

- `ingest/<tag>` — adding knowledge from a source or batch
- `consolidate/<date>` — structural cleanup (merges, prunes, consolidation)

Commit messages follow conventions so history filters work:

```
ingest(<tag>): N neurons from <source>
consolidate: <summary>
review(<YYYY-MM-DD>): N fired (<correct>/<total>)
manual: <user-supplied summary>
```

Inspecting and rolling back:

```bash
spkt history -n 20                      # recent brain commits
spkt history --grep ingest              # filter by message
spkt undo                               # revert HEAD (asks first)
spkt undo --to <sha>                    # revert everything since <sha>
spkt undo --ingest-tag papers-2026-04   # revert a tagged batch
```

`spkt undo` is a `git revert` wrapper — history is preserved, never rewritten,
so a bad undo can itself be undone.

If you'd rather manage git yourself, init without it:

```bash
spkt init --no-git
```

### Visualize

```bash
# Generate interactive HTML graph
spkt visualize -o graph.html
```

## Agent Skills

Skills are LLM-powered interaction modes designed to run inside
**Agent CLIs** — tools like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
or similar coding agents that combine LLM reasoning with shell access.

The core engine is LLM-independent — `spkt` commands work standalone.
Skills add conversational interactions on top: tutoring, curation, and Q&A.

### `/spkt-tutor` — AI Tutor

A 1-on-1 tutor that teaches, quizzes, and coaches — not just a quiz machine.

The tutor decides what to do based on your state: teach a concept you're weak on,
quiz you to check understanding, give feedback on mistakes, or answer your questions.

**Example session:**

```
> /spkt-tutor

Tutor: You have 5 concepts due. Functor has low stability and is
       a prerequisite for Monad, so let's start there.

       [LECTURE] A Functor is a mapping between categories that
       preserves structure. Think of it as a box you can map over...
       (explains with examples, using concepts you already know)

       Let me check your understanding.

       [QUIZ] What must a Functor preserve when mapping?

You:   The structure of the category?

Tutor: [FEEDBACK] That's on the right track, but let's be more precise.
       A Functor must preserve identity morphisms and composition.
       So fmap id = id, and fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g.

       Let me try a different angle.

       [QUIZ] In Haskell, why is `fmap` different from `map`?

You:   map only works on lists, fmap works on any Functor?

Tutor: [FEEDBACK] Exactly! `map` is specialized to lists, while `fmap`
       is the generalized version for any Functor instance. ✅ fire
       Stability: 3.2 → 8.1 days

       Now let's move to Monad, which builds on what you just learned...
```

**What the tutor can do:**

| Action | When | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Diagnose | Session start | "Functor is weak and blocks Monad — start there" |
| Lecture | New or weak concept | Structured explanation using known concepts as anchors |
| Quiz | After teaching | Varied questions (not just "what is X?") |
| Feedback | After your answer | Explains why right/wrong, what was missing |
| Q&A | You ask a question | Pedagogical answer using your brain's knowledge |
| Drill | Persistent weakness | Focused repetition with varied question angles |

### `/spkt-ingest` — Knowledge Curation

Add knowledge through conversation. The agent structures your input,
discovers related concepts, and creates connections.

**Example session:**

```
> /spkt-ingest

What would you like to add?

> Monads in Haskell use bind (>>=) to chain computations.
  IO and Maybe are common examples.

I'll create a neuron:

── Monad ──
# モナド (Monad)
bind (>>=) で計算を連鎖させる。
Examples: IO (side effects), Maybe (failure handling)

Found 2 related concepts:
  1. Functor (0.82) → requires
  2. Applicative (0.78) → requires

Create with these connections? [Y/n]

✅ Added n-abc123, linked to Functor and Applicative
```

**What the agent does:**

- Structures raw input into well-formed Markdown neurons
- Splits multi-concept input into atomic neurons
- Checks for duplicates before adding
- Discovers related existing knowledge and suggests connections
- Proposes types and domains based on existing patterns

### `/spkt-qabot` — Knowledge Q&A

Ask questions and get answers from your brain. Retrieval quality
improves through the conversation.

**Example session:**

```
> /spkt-qabot

Ask me anything about your brain.

> What's the difference between Functor and Applicative?

A Functor lets you map a function over a wrapped value (fmap).
An Applicative extends this — it lets you apply a wrapped function
to a wrapped value (<*>). Every Applicative is a Functor, but
Applicative adds the ability to combine independent effects...

Sources: n-abc123 (Functor), n-def456 (Applicative), n-ghi789 (Monad)

> Can you go deeper on how Applicative relates to Monad?

[Previous results automatically penalized — retrieves new material]

Over-smoothing occurs when node representations converge as
GCN layers increase. After ~5 layers, all nodes have nearly
identical features...

Sources: n-jkl012 (Deep GNN analysis), n-mno345 (Spectral theory)

> Great, thanks

✅ Accepted: sources boosted for future retrieval
```

**How feedback works:**

- **Similar follow-up** → prior results weren't enough → they get penalized
- **"Thanks" / acceptance** → results were helpful → they get boosted
- **Topic change** → session resets, starts fresh
- **Persistent mode** → feedback survives across sessions

### `/spkt-curator` — Brain Curator

Conversational brain maintenance. Analyzes domain-community alignment,
resolves orphans, cleans up weak synapses, and runs consolidation — all
through dialogue.

```
> /spkt-curator

Curator: Your "math" domain spans 2 communities:
  c0: algebra, rings, fields (12 neurons)
  c3: calculus, limits, derivatives (8 neurons)

Split into "math-algebra" and "math-analysis"? [Y/n]

> y

✅ Renamed 8 neurons to "math-analysis".

3 orphan neurons found. Connect "Set Theory basics" to "math-algebra"? [Y/n]
```

## Python API

For building custom integrations, agents, or LLM adapters.

# Ask — returns scored, deduplicated results
results = await session.ask("What is a functor?")

# Positive feedback — boost helpful neurons
await session.accept([results[0].neuron_id])

# Follow-up — auto-penalizes prior results if similar
results = await session.ask("functor examples in Haskell?")

await session.close()  # commits boosts to DB
```

### IngestSession

```python
from spikuit_core import IngestSession, SynapseType

session = IngestSession(circuit)

# Add knowledge — auto-discovers related concepts
neuron, related = await session.ingest(
    "# Functor\n\nA mapping between categories.",
    type="concept", domain="math",
)

# Create connections
if related:
    await session.relate(neuron.id, related[0].id, SynapseType.REQUIRES)

# Merge duplicates
await session.merge(["n-old1", "n-old2"], into_id="n-keep")

await session.close()
```
