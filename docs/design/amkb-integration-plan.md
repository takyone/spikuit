# AMKB Integration Plan — Spikuit v0.7.x

**Status.** Draft. Targets merge as `v0.7.0` and `v0.7.1`, branched
from `v0.6.2`. Written against `amkb-spec` v0.2.0 and `amkb-sdk`
v0.0.1 (name reserved on PyPI; usable API lands with `amkb==0.1.0`
after this work ships).

**Goal.** Let any AMKB-aware consumer drive a Spikuit brain through
the `amkb.Store` Protocol — without changing what existing
`spkt` users see, what the engine computes, or the shape of
existing DB rows.

## Constraints (non-negotiable)

1. **No core-logic leakage into AMKB surface.** APPNP, FSRS,
   pressure dynamics, community detection, and embedder internals
   MUST NOT appear in any type, method, or event that the adapter
   exposes. AMKB consumers see Nodes/Edges/Events only.
2. **No existing feature may regress.** `spkt` CLI behavior, DB
   compatibility (existing columns keep existing semantics), and
   every current test case must still pass on the
   `amkb-integration` branch before merge. New AMKB behavior is
   opt-in — triggered only when the caller goes through the
   adapter.
3. **Dependency direction is one-way.** `spikuit-agents/amkb/`
   depends on `spikuit-core`. `spikuit-core` MUST NOT depend on
   `amkb-sdk` types or import from the adapter. If a helper is
   reusable, it lives in `amkb-sdk` (`amkb.validation`,
   `amkb.snapshots`, etc.) and the adapter calls it.
4. **Additive DB migrations only.** New columns default to
   NULL / sensible defaults. No destructive migrations, no column
   renames, no dropped tables.

Any PR that breaks one of these constraints is rolled back; the
plan does not accept "small" exceptions.

## Two-milestone split

The work splits cleanly along the core/adapter boundary.

### v0.7.0 — AMKB core plumbing

Adds the minimum `spikuit-core` primitives that an adapter needs
to satisfy AMKB L1 (Core) conformance. Nothing here is
AMKB-shaped on the outside — the types stay `Neuron`/`Synapse`,
the methods stay async — but the behaviors required by the
protocol become available.

Scope (detailed in `amkb-core-plumbing-spec.md`):

- **Soft-retire for Neuron and Synapse** — add `retired_at`
  nullable column. Soft-retire becomes the **only** delete path
  for both core and CLI; physical purging is explicit via
  `spkt history prune`. Vector index rows are physically deleted
  on retire to keep ANN recall undegraded.
- **Event log** — new `changeset` / `event` tables. Each mutation
  appends rows. Read-only consumers can replay.
- **Transaction wrapper** — `async with circuit.transaction(tag,
  actor) as tx:` that buffers mutations and emits one ChangeSet on
  commit. Direct calls to `add_neuron` etc. auto-commit in a
  one-op transaction to keep existing CLI behavior.
- **Predecessor tracking** — `neuron_predecessor` junction table
  populated by merge. `circuit.predecessors(id)` already exists
  for graph adjacency; lineage is a separate concept.
- **Canonical error mapping** — a small adapter-side table that
  maps Spikuit's internal exceptions to `amkb.errors` codes. Core
  raises its own exceptions as today; the adapter translates.
- **Source as Node (adapter-only)** — Spikuit keeps Sources in the
  `source` table. The adapter presents each row as a virtual
  `Node(kind="source", layer="L_source")` without changing
  storage. Junction `neuron_source` becomes the `derived_from`
  edge set on read.

### v0.7.1 — AMKB adapter + conformance

Adds `spikuit-agents/src/spikuit_agents/amkb/` with:

- `store.py` — `SpikuitStore` class satisfying `amkb.Store`
- `transaction.py` — `SpikuitTransaction` satisfying
  `amkb.Transaction`
- `mapping.py` — Neuron ↔ Node, Synapse ↔ Edge, error
  translation, attestation rel mapping
- `conformance/` — fixture that instantiates a temp Brain,
  a root `conftest.py` wiring the `store` fixture to the
  conformance suite, and a CI job running
  `pytest --pyargs amkb.conformance`

Exit criteria:

- All L1 conformance tests pass
- L2 lineage tests pass
- L4a structural tests pass
- L4b intent tests pass
- L3 transactional: capability flags opted in where supported,
  skipped otherwise (same model as the dict test store)

## Dependency with v1.0.0 feature issues

Several v1.0.0 issues can reuse the v0.7.0 plumbing for free and
become easier to land on top of it. This is the reason to insert
v0.7.x before v1.0.0 rather than after.

| Issue | Title | Why AMKB plumbing helps |
|---|---|---|
| #12 | Conversational Curation — graph editing in /learn | Transactions + event log give the /learn session a replayable audit trail without inventing one |
| #13 | Feedback queue — separate proposal from application | Proposal = ChangeSet not yet committed; application = commit. Natural fit |
| #17 | Conflict detection — find contradictory neurons | Needs lineage to explain _why_ two neurons are contradictory; predecessor chain is that lineage |

These issues stay in v1.0.0 but become lower-risk after v0.7.x.
Milestone reordering is not required.

## Rollout sequence

1. **Cut branch.** `amkb-integration` from `main` at v0.6.2 (done).
2. **Write design docs.** This file + `amkb-core-plumbing-spec.md`
   land in `docs/design/` first, for review _before_ any code.
3. **v0.7.0 implementation.** DB migrations, transaction wrapper,
   event log, soft-retire. Each behavior behind its own test.
   Every existing test must stay green after each step.
4. **v0.7.1 implementation.** Adapter in `spikuit-agents/amkb/`.
   Conformance suite wired up. CI job added.
5. **Rebase on main.** If v0.6.3 or v0.6.4 have shipped by then,
   rebase `amkb-integration` and re-run tests. Non-overlapping
   areas mean rebase should be trivial.
6. **PR + merge.** Two PRs (one per milestone) so review is
   chunked. Release notes call out "AMKB Protocol support is opt
   in; existing CLI usage is unchanged."

## Non-goals for v0.7.x

- **No `spkt amkb` CLI.** The adapter is programmatic only this
  round. A CLI surface can come later.
- **No Spikuit-side break of `amkb-sdk`.** If the adapter surfaces
  a gap in the SDK (missing Store method, missing error code),
  the fix lands in `amkb-sdk` first and `amkb-integration`
  consumes the new version.
- **No retrieval semantic change.** `retrieve` keeps returning
  Spikuit's APPNP+semantic+FSRS-retrievability scores. AMKB
  callers see those same scores unchanged — AMKB does not
  prescribe an ISF, so Spikuit's function satisfies the L4b
  contract as-is.
- **No resurrection semantics.** Reverting a retire/merge is out
  of scope until the protocol and Spikuit agree on what
  "unretire" means in the presence of FSRS state. Conformance
  tests that require resurrection are left capability-skipped,
  same as the dict test store.

## Risks

- **Rebase pain if v0.6.3/v0.6.4 touch `spikuit-core/db.py`.**
  Low probability (both milestones are in different subsystems),
  but we should land v0.7.0 before v0.6.4 if possible to keep
  the migration sequence linear.
- **Transaction wrapper complexity.** Buffering writes without
  breaking the async auto-commit model is the riskiest piece.
  Mitigation: ship the wrapper first, with its own pytest
  coverage, before building anything on top.
- **Event log growth.** An always-on event log grows unbounded.
  v0.7.0 ships with no pruning — this is acceptable while the
  feature is opt-in, but v1.0.0 needs a retention policy
  (separate issue).
- **Adapter depends on `amkb==0.0.1` which is intentionally
  unusable.** The adapter branch will pin a local path or
  `amkb @ git+...` until `amkb==0.1.0` ships. v0.7.1 release is
  gated on that.

## Success criteria

- `amkb-integration` merges to main with zero regressions in
  existing `spikuit-core` / `spikuit-cli` tests
- `pytest --pyargs amkb.conformance` run from a Spikuit test
  directory passes L1/L2/L4a/L4b
- No `amkb.*` import appears in `spikuit-core`
- No Spikuit internal type (Neuron, Synapse, Circuit) appears in
  any AMKB-facing API
- `spkt` CLI behavior is byte-identical to v0.6.2 for every
  existing subcommand under test coverage, with one deliberate
  exception: `spkt stats --json` gains additive fields
  (`neurons_retired`, related counts). No existing field
  changes semantics. No other command's output is allowed to
  drift
- `retrieve` recall@k is unchanged on a zero-retired fixture,
  and within noise on a 30%-retired fixture (ANN index is
  physically cleaned on retire)
